Words like \"movie\" and \"film\" are plotted close to each other, which is indicative of the model's ability to understand their contextual and semantic relatedness. The same goes for words with positive connotations such as \"good,\" \"great,\" and \"enjoyable,\" which are also grouped together. This suggests that the model has effectively captured the notion that these words often appear in similar contexts.\n","\n","The word \"bad\" is placed away from the other positive words, which is an excellent sign that the model is discerning the opposite sentiment associated with it. However, the presence of \"film\" somewhat distant from \"movie\" gives me pause—it may suggest that while the model has learned a great deal, there's still room for improvement in capturing nuances between synonyms.\n","\n","I'm pleased to see that my implementation of the KNN algorithm using cosine similarity has yielded a logical and interpretable mapping of word vectors. It's evident that the words closest to a given target word in the embedding space are those that are contextually or semantically related. The embeddings reflect a meaningful structure in the high-dimensional space, which is precisely what we aim for in word vector representations."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"FHTmB2uGAZkI","metadata":{"id":"FHTmB2uGAZkI"},"outputs":[],"source":[]}],"metadata":{"accelerator":"GPU","colab":{"gpuType":"T4","provenance":[]},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.10.9"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
